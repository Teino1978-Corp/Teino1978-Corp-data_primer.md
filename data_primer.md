### Data primer: Defense Logistics Agency's 1033 data

**Q**: What are the agencies, terms and acronyms related to the 1033 program?

**A**: Here are a few:

   * **DLA**: the Defense Logistics Agency, the arm of the Department of Defense that manages the 1033 program
   * **MRAP**: a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle
   * **LEA**: a law enforcement agency, such as a local police department
   * **NSN**: the National Stock Number, a 13-digit code used by the military to identify equipment
 
**Q**: Have the number of items acquired by local law enforcement agencies through the 1033 program increased over time?

**A**: The data released by the DLA on Nov. 21 should be considered a snapshot, not a historical record. The DLA tracks "non-controlled" items for one year, and the item is then removed from active inventory. The DLA only tracks "controlled" items that are currently at LEAs. Since the information is partial, we can't make historical comparisons.
 
For example, the data doesn't allow us to say equipment acquired by an agency has increased over time. Instead, the question could be reframed as: "When did the equipment that is currently at LEAs arrive at those agencies?"

**Q**: Controlled, non-controlled & mdash; what do those terms mean?

**A**: Those are two different classifications for the 1033 equipment. LEAs must track controlled property for as long as it's in their possession. Strictly speaking, "controlled property is defined as personal property that has a Department of State, Department of Commerce, or Department of Defense control," according to the DLA's Tonya Johnson.

Certain demilitarization and integrity codes (which are present in the data) relate to an items status as controlled or non-controlled. You can find the definition of controlled property in the California certification package for (the 1033 program)[http://www.calema.ca.gov/publicsafetyandvictimservices/pages/about-the-1033-program.aspx ].
 
**Q**: What's a demilitarization code?

**A**: You can go down that rabbit hole [here](http://www.dlis.dla.mil/demil/demil_codes.asp) and in these three volumes of the Defense Demilitarization Manual.

   * [Vol. 1](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/416028m_vol1.pdf)
   * [Vol. 2](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/416028m_vol2.pdf)
   * [Vol. 3](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/416028m_vol3.pdf)

**Q**: Are controlled items weapons? Does "controlled" mean the same thing as "tactical"?

**A**: "You cannot make that distinction because the tactical equipment definition can be subjective," the DLA's Tonya Johnson said. She provided a list of 13 general types of equipment which the DLA would consider tactical (including aircraft, "tactical vehicles", and robots), but clarified that the DLA does not maintain a list of the National Stock Numbers, or NSNs, that the DLA considers tactical.
 
**Q**: Are the 1033 items brand new?

**A**: Not usually. According to a fact sheet provided to Congress on the 1033 program by DLA director Mark Harnitchek &mdash; available in this [ACLU report](link: https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-police-report) &mdash; about 36 percent of equipment is new. About 64 percent &mdash; nearly two-thirds &mdash; is used.
 
**Q**: Does the equipment arrive in good condition?

**A**: It varies. When the Glendora, Calif. Police Department received two Peacekeeper-style armored vehicles in 1997, the department ended up using one in dozens of SWAT operations and the [other for parts](http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/08/15/46015/michael-brown-congressman-wants-to-curb-military-s/).
